            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He reverend and learned Author of this enſuing Treatiſe, having had of late an unpleaſing li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Imployments, wherein he hath for theſe many years laſt paſt been exerciſed with much accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and precious fruit, and being ſtudious how he might beſt ſerve his Generation, and improve his time and talent for common benefit, did engage himſelf (moved no doubt thereunto from above) to the ſtudy of the book of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59164:4"/>and to make a ſearch into the deep Myſteries contained in it, the rather that he and others by his means might the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the mind of God in the way of his providential diſpenſations, which are ſo variouſly interpreted, and at which ſo many ſtumble and fall. The Province, the task, though dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, yet is proper for him, and men of his capacity to undertake, to whom the <hi>Arcana Coeli,</hi> the lively O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, the myſteries of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God are committed, and whoſe duty it is to make Viſions plain.</p>
            <p>In this work the Author hath laboured ad <hi>ſudorem, ad pallorem;</hi> and no doubt found it to be <hi>dolor in oculis,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt phraſes it. When he had laboured much in this work, and had brought it <hi>ad umbilicum,</hi> knowing and conſidering with himſelf, as <hi>Piſcator</hi> did upon the very ſame occaſion, <hi>That we know but in part, propheſie but in part,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:59164:4"/>
               <hi>that the ſpirits of the Prophets are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Prophets,</hi> he willingly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his papers to the peruſal, and ſubmitted them to the judgement and cenſure of his Brethren, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, to me, the leaſt of all, whoſe acquaintance with the Author and his work within not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hours bears the ſame date. And I muſt profeſs I count it a mercy to have acquaintance with both, and do cordially own the Work for the Authors ſake, and the Author for the Works ſake.</p>
            <p>After I had ſaluted the Treatiſe, <hi>a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> I found more and more encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to paſs further and further into it, and having peruſed it was fully concurrent in my judgement upon it, with others that had run the lines before me, that it was <hi>Opus praelo dignum,</hi> and did heartily preſs the publication of it, as that which would be of precious uſe, and much for benefit to ſuch as deſire to move by the <hi>Apocalyptique</hi> line, wiſhing
<pb facs="tcp:59164:5"/>that being well taught it might have the faireſt gales, and a moſt gainful trade.</p>
            <p>Reader, the Treatiſe is now in thy hand, and wilt thou not take cognizance of it, and be acquainted with it? <hi>Solomon</hi> gives it for the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a fool, That he hath a price in his hand to get knowledge, and hath no heart to it; will it be for thy honour to be ſo charactred? When the little book mentioned <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. was held in the hand of him that ſate on the Throne, and none found worthy to open it, and look into it, <hi>John</hi> was deeply affected, and wept much, to think that a Book that would be ſo much for the Churches benefit, ſhould remain a ſealed book. God hath made gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious proviſion formerly, and now of late, that by Labours and Lucubrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this and other the faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt, this myſterious book ſhould be opened, and elucidated, the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> explained; and ſhall not
<pb facs="tcp:59164:5"/>this precious proviſion be accepted and made uſe of?</p>
            <p>Thou haſt in this Book, which the Author hath laboured in, an account given in a prophetical and myſterious way, of a Lamb ſlain, but alive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſtanding on Mount <hi>Zion</hi> in a military poſture, fighting, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering, and going out to conquer. A Lamb I ſay, ſo the great Shepherd of the ſheep delights to be ſtiled and called by his Lambs and Sheep.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thou haſt an account of a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bride, in beauty and bravery, made ready for the Lamb her Husband, and the ſolemnization of their happy Nuptials after Eſpouſals.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of a foul and formidale Beaſt, ſucceeding a great red Dragon, in place and power, and under ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pretences of holding correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with the Lamb, making war againſt him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Of a ſcarlet coloured Whore, having upon her the names of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, and in her hand a golden
<pb facs="tcp:59164:6"/>cup full of abominations, and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of her fornication, inebriating therewith the Kings and Princes, and Inhabiters of the earth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Of the followers of the Lamb, in their numbers witneſſing to him, warring with him, and ſuffering for him, and then appearing with his fathers name in their foreheads, with Crowns and Palms, rejoycing and triumphing, having gotten the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over the Beaſt and over his Image, and over his Mark, and over the Number of his name.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Of the followers of the Beaſt, and fornicators with the Whore, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a Beaſts mark, and their dreadful doom, as perſons that were not the Lambs <hi>Milites conſcripti,</hi> not written in the Lambs Book of life.</p>
            <p>Briefly, Thou haſt an account of ſeven Seals, ſeven loud ſounding Trumpets, ſeven Vials filled up with hot ſcorching and ſcalding wrath, and poured out upon the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world. Theſe and other the
<pb facs="tcp:59164:6"/>like myſterious things are held forth in this Book of <hi>Revelations,</hi> and in part cleared up in the Writings of this and other the ſervants of Chriſt, make uſe then of this proviſion made, and bleſs God, that thereby thou art in a fair way to poſſeſs that bleſſing which in <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. is pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on them, and aſcertained to them that read, and hear, and keep the ſayings of this Book. The time ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens wherein the things contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it will have their full accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment; and then inſtead of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of things to be done, it will turn it ſelf into a Hiſtory of things already done; beleive it now as a Propheſie, that thou mayſt rejoyce in it as a Hiſtory. And take heed leſt through neglect to labour and ſearch for the right underſtanding of this Book, by ſuch holy helps, thou be not found in compliance with Beaſt-worſhip, and fall under the power of that word which is pronounced in a judicial way, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.
<pb facs="tcp:59164:7"/>
               <hi>Let him that is filthy, ſuperſtitious, idolatrous, be ſo ſtill;</hi> which Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is doing quick and ſevere exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution at this day.</p>
            <p>A word or two more (that I may not hold thee too long at the door) The time is haſtening wherein the Lamb of <hi>Zion</hi> will compleat his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries over the Beaſt of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and then Beaſt and falſe Prophet ſhall be caſt into the lake of fire, and the ſmoak of their torment ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend out of the bottomleſs pit: Make it thy care that when others ſhall be found the marked followers of the Beaſt, thou mayſt be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſealed followers of the Lamb; while others defile their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with Antichriſtian filth, ſoil and ſtain them with Superſtitious and falſe Worſhips, thou mayſt have thine cloſe and clean upon thee, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made them white in the blood of the Lamb; ſo ſhalt thou be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled comfortably to wait for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of the Beaſts 42. moneths,
<pb facs="tcp:59164:7"/>and therewith the downfal of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and the expiration of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes 1260 days, and therewith their riſing again; the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet, the coming down of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnization of the Marriage between the Lamb and his Bride, and bear a part with the Lambs triumphing followers in their rejoycings, that the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth, that he hath taken to himſelf his great power, and that at laſt the Kingdoms of the World are become the Kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Book is called a <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> becauſe it makes known to us ſecret hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den myſteries, and future events. It is called the <hi>Revelation of John</hi> the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, that is <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle or Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt; called <hi>John the Divine,</hi> by way of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar emphaſis, becauſe as an Eagle he ſoars aloft, writes more ſublimely of the Divinity of Chriſt Jeſus, as in his Goſpel and Firſt Epiſtle, ſo in this Book,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59164:9"/>where <hi>Pareus</hi> obſerves there are forty eight arguments of Chriſts Divinity. This <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt and Apoſtle was Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of this <hi>Revelation,</hi> who wrote this book after all the books of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been penned and publiſhed, he ſurviving after all the reſt of the Apoſtles, and lived (as <hi>Sophronius</hi> thinks) to the third year of <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperor, which was in the one hundred and ſecond year after Chriſts birth, as <hi>Helvicus</hi> computes. It compleats and ſeals up the whole canon of the Old and New Teſtament, cap. 22. 7, 14, 18, 19.</p>
            <p>The time when he wrote this <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> was when he was baniſhed into the Iſle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> for the Word of God and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus, by that cruel perſecutor <hi>Domitian</hi> in the fourteenth year of his Reign, ſaith <hi>Hierem. Domitian</hi> raigned in all but fifteen years, and his fourteenth year was the 96 year after Chriſt (as <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicus</hi> computes) So that from <hi>Johns</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this <hi>Revelation,</hi> ſuppoſe in the 102 year after Chriſt, to this preſent year 1662 are 1560 years.</p>
            <p>It is alſo called the <hi>Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> becauſe he is the author of it, even Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, the faithful and true
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59164:9"/>witneſs, who ſent his Angel to teſtifie the ſame to <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle, and by him to the Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.22.16.</p>
            <p>And though it be called a <hi>Revelation,</hi> and the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> and of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe it doth make known to us hidden myſteries, and future events, yet its not without mixture of much intricate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and obſcurity; having as <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith, as many myſteries as words. Sundry Books of Holy Scripture are hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, eſpecially thoſe that are propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; but among all the prophetical books, chiefly this. It is a book full of obſcure and intricate viſions, making known abſtruſe and hidden myſteries, moſt myſteriouſly, and that in relation to future times; And therefore the profoundeſt judgement of interpreters, is here not onely excerciſed but puzled, ſo that they muſt acknowledge here are many knots they cannot unty, and mighty deeps, through which they cannot fully wade.</p>
            <p>The opening of the ſeven ſeals, the ſounding of the ſeven Trumpets, the pouring out of the ſeven Viols, who can fully comprehend? <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.1.6.1.8.6.16.1. The profound Myſteries of the meaſuring of Gods Temple and Altar;

            <p> Yea, I verily beleive no mortal creature on earth, is able fully to underſtand and penetrate into all the profound depths and myſteries of this book, which hath ſo exerciſed and puzled all interpreters. Yet this I think, if ſome things therein, by help of divine light, may be cleared, though all cannot, he that writes ſhall be a gainer, and he that reads ſhall be no loſer.</p>
            <p>Therefore I write this, that I may by Divine aſſiſtance give ſome light to the underſtanding of ſome things in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and ſacred Propheſie, the myſteries therein being revealed, that they might be underſtood, the true underſtanding whereof ſo much concerns us, and the Church of God in this laſt hour of the world.</p>

            <p>Now the Scope or intent of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Parts of the book.</note> is more generally to make known to the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> and by <hi>John</hi> to the Churches, the preſent things that then were, when the <hi>Revelation</hi> was given, and the future things that ſhould be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from <hi>Johns</hi> time to the end of the World, as the title of the Book intimates, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.1.1.19.</p>

            <p>Secondly, Chriſt appeareth to <hi>John</hi> as a beaſt in the ſhape of a Lamb, with ſeven horns and ſeven eyes, and openeth the book ſealed (the ſecret and hidden

            <p>And that both in the firſt, ſecond and third period.</p>
            <p>In the firſt period, which by opening the firſt ſix ſeals is performed; cap. 6. where in the firſt five ſeals, is ſet forth the condition of the Church under the Heathen Emperors; but in the ſixth, the full of Heatheniſm under the Chriſtian Emperors, from <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, until the death or after the death of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:59164:17"/>is prefigured. In brief the meaning of the firſt ſix ſeals is this,</p>
            <p>That Prince of unſpotted righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the rider of the white horſe, with his arrow and his bow in his hand aimeth at ſomething of high importance (and it is no leſs then what he promiſeth his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers at their loweſt ebb, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.32. <hi>Fear not little flock, for it is your fathers good pleaſure to give you the Kingdom</hi>) and he hits the mark in the ſixth Seal, where the Pagan Empire is ſhattered to the purpoſe by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> turning Chriſtian. But to adorn the courſe of time till then by ſome prophetick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, the Riders of the Red, Black and Pale Horſes are brought in, as alſo moſt concerningly the cry of the ſouls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Altar; whereby is denoted eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the reign of <hi>Diecleſian,</hi> and that ten years unparalleld perſecution then commencing; which fifth Seal, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuing of the Empire into the hands of Chriſt by the ſubverſion of the Pagan power, doth immediately ſucceed, and is matter of the ſixth Seal, figured out by proper prophetical expreſſions, as of a great earthquake, the eclipſe of the Sun and Moon, and falling of the ſtars, which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59164:17"/>Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> interprets to be when by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the Great and his Suceſſors, there was ſuch a mighty change and ſubverſion of the Roman Heatheniſh affairs (ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied here by the great earthquake) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all the heatheniſh gods were ſhaken from their heaven, their Prieſts rejected, and for ever deprived of their revenue, their Idol Temples broken, pulled down, burnt, demoliſhed, throughout the whole Roman world; and the Emperors, Kings and Potentates endeavouring to ſuccour their indangered gods, themſelves ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, frighted, put to flight, at laſt none daring to defend their Roman Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Religion, ſo terribly cruſhed and fallen. This is the firſt complement of Chriſts victory over the Roman heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Empire, the foundation whereof Chriſt laid in the firſt Seal. For the particular accommodation of events to the particulars of the Text, I refer the Reader to Mr. <hi>Joſeph Mede</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary upon the Apocalyps, whoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication is very orderly, proper and articulate, in the explication of the four firſt Seals, where the lion on the eaſt ſide of the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> camp is applied to Chriſt the Prince from the Eaſt; the nature of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59164:18"/>the lion being ſutable to the thing ſignified in the viſion, <hi>viz.</hi> victory to him on the white horſe; and the like in the reſt. For ſo the Ox on the Weſt ſide of the camp is applied to <hi>Trajan</hi> from the weſt; the man on the South ſide to <hi>Septimius</hi> from the South; and the Eagle on the North ſide to <hi>Maximinus</hi> from the North; The natures alſo of the viſions, are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the things that came to paſs under thoſe Emperors.</p>
            <p>The mighty ſlaughters under <hi>Trajan</hi> and <hi>Adrian</hi> his ſucceſſor, are indigitated by the Oxe: The exactneſs of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring juſtice, and careful proviſion of <hi>Septimius,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> by a man to whom numbring, and meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and adminiſtration of juſtice is ſo proper.</p>
            <p>The extraordinary raging of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, Sword, and Peſtilence, under <hi>Maximinus,</hi> by the carnivorous Eagle that feeds upon dead Cakaſſes. All which applications, as they are eaſie, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and diſtinſt, ſo they are very weighty and worthy the Spirit of God and his holy Prophets to predict.</p>

This ten horned Beaſt, as was mentioned before, is the Dragons Delegate or Subſtitute; he is ſaid to riſe out of the Sea; by Sea here, underſtand that multitude of ten King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, into which the Barbarians had ſhredded the whole compaſs of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Territories, out of all which the Dragon now endeavours to extract, and of which to compoſe one Roman <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or that conflux of Armies and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſtriving in war like a tempeſtuous Sea; He is ſaid to have ſeven heads, and ſo is the ſame beaſt, <hi>cap.</hi> 17.3. compared with <hi>verſ.</hi> 9, 10. His ſeven heads, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted by the Holy Ghoſt himſelf, to be ſeven Mountains, whereon the

            <p>The names of blaſphemy, notes his blaſphemous idolatries, tending to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream reproach of God, his Religion and Saints; his ten horns, and upon his horns,<note place="margin">Voyce out of the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, p. 38.</note> ten crowns, theſe ſignifie that he ſhould not come to his crown by the ſtrength of his Sword, his Leaders, and his Legions,<note place="margin">But of the crowns upon the hornes, ſee ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. p. 90.</note> as the Dragon did, but by the baſe and voluntary ſubmiſſion of all the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> Kings and Princes, as ſhould with one Councel and Vote, deliver up their authority and power ſecular to the devotion and pleaſure of the beaſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he wears his Diadems, not upon his heads, as the Dragon did, but upon his Hornes, and upon his Hornes ten crownes.</p>
            <p>Which ten Hornes crowned, ſay moſt Writers, denote ten Kings or Kingdomes, into which the Roman Empire of the ſixth head, was divived, all which were to be conjoyned,<note place="margin">Mede in Cum. Apoc. <hi>part. 2. cap. 13.</hi>
               </note> into one for carrying of the whore. Theſe 10. horns thinks <hi>Mede,</hi> belong not to all the ſeven heads, but onely to the ſeventh, becauſe the heads

Now theſe ten horns cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the firſt five heads, becauſe in <hi>Johns</hi> time, theſe five were fallen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.10. and conſequently their hornes with them; nor can theſe horns belong to the ſixth head, which then was in <hi>Johns</hi> time raigning; for the Angel tels <hi>John</hi> plainly, the ten horns are ten Kings, which have received no Kingdom as yet; compare <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.10. with the 12. verſe. Therefore it remaines that theſe ten horns belong onely to the ſeventh or laſt head.</p>
            <p>Again, this beaſt is deſcribed by his ſhape, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>And the beaſt that I ſaw was like a Leopard,</hi> i. e. like unto the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy, reſembled by a Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard, and divided into four heads, as this Roman into ten, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.7.</p>
            <p>The Leopard, is a beaſt all ſpotted,<note place="margin">Pareus <hi>in</hi> Apoc. <hi>13.2.</hi>
               </note> very ſwift, extream cruel, a notable Embleme of this preſent beaſt,<note place="margin">Voice out of the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, p. 37.</note> who for his preſumption in extolling himſelf above the Prince of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, defiling his Sanctuary, deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Sacrifice, burning his Statutes, and inforcing the humble and meek to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59164:27"/>the abnegation of the truth, by blood, fire, ſtrapadoes, and ſuch like exquiſite torments, the ſpirit reſembles him to his Arch-type, <hi>Autiochus,</hi> deſcended from the Monarch of <hi>Greece,</hi> here (as in <hi>Daniel</hi>) deciphered by a Leopard, <hi>and I ſaw the beaſt like a Leopard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly for his ſtrength, cruelty, and devouring nature, the ſpirit likeneth him to a Bear, <hi>and his feet were like the feet of a Bear,</hi> ſtrong, cruel, and of a devouring nature, the embleme of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarcy; It had ſaith <hi>Daniel,</hi> Cap. 7.5. three ribs in the teeth of it, and they ſaid thus unto it, <hi>Ariſe and devour much fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Holy Ghoſt likeneth him to the Lyons mouth. The Lion was an Embleme of the firſt Monarcy, the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by lonians;</hi> the Lions mouth notes ſtrength and cruetly in tearing, cruſhing, and ſwallowing up his prey; yea, herein the Holy Ghoſt aſcribeth unto him the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and curſed mouth of the Monarch of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in commanding the dwellers upon earth,<note place="margin">Dan. 7.4</note> upon pain of fire and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, to adore his golden Idol that he had ſet up.</p>
            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:59164:27"/>
            <p> How notably ſets this our the Character of this beaſt, his parts being framed of the moſt notable perſecutors that ever were, being a confection or compound, made up of the terribleneſs, ſtrength and cruelty of all the three foregoing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies! hence <hi>Daniel</hi> admirably deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth this fourth Beaſt, <hi>Dan</hi> 7.7. as dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and terrible, and ſtrong exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, And it had great Iron teeth.</p>
            <p>Further, the Holy Ghoſt deſcribes him as by his ſhape, ſo by his State and conſtitution; he was veſted with great power, and Royal Dominion; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the holy Ghoſt ſets down the efficient cauſe, the manner of acquiring it, and the event of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The efficient cauſe of it, we have in the latter end of the ſecond Verſe. <hi>viz.</hi> The Dragon; the Dragon gave him his power and his ſeat, and great authority; by <hi>power</hi> Scripture notes, not onely ſtrength, but bands, armies and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of perſons; The Dragons Bands or Army, are his Angels or Devils with Idols their receptacles (ſaith <hi>Mede</hi>) theſe he gives to this beaſt, together with his Seat and great authority, <hi>viz.</hi> all that authority which he had in the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59164:28"/>heatheniſh Roman Empire, from which <hi>Michael</hi> and the Martyrs caſt him down, overcoming him; this he gives to the beaſt his Subſtitute, to recover it for him.</p>
            <p>How cunningly now Satan acts, not now as a red Dragon, but as masked in a new manyformed beaſt, to draw the Church to Idolatry under the Chriſtian Empire!</p>
            <p n="2">2. The manner of his acquiring this Dominion, by healing of his mortal wound, received in his ſixth head, by the barbarous Nations,<note place="margin">Or rather according to <hi>Mede,</hi> by <hi>Michaels</hi> Victory over the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.</note> but now cured by this ſubſtituted power of the Beaſt, in the courſe of his ſeventh and laſt head,<note place="margin">See theſe two opi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nions reconciled after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</note> 
               <hi>And I ſaw one of his heads as it were wounded to death, and his deadly wound was healed,</hi> v. 3.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The event of this his great Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the World, generally all admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and adoring this beaſt, thus healed and now termed as the Dragons De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, <hi>viz.</hi> highly approving of him, and ſubjecting themſelves to him and his power, as incomparable and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible. Adoring in Scripture, is put
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59164:28"/>for yeilding ſubjection,<note place="margin">Gen. 27.29.37.7. and 49.8. Eſa. 45. In obeying the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, or the Popes Idolatrous, decrees, they not onely Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped them, but the Devil in them; for the Dragon gave them that power, and his work they did.</note> And all the World wondred after the beaſt, and they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the Dragon, who gave power unto the beaſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> they ſubjected themſelves to the Dragon in the Beaſt, and they worſhipped the beaſt, ſaying, <hi>who is like unto the Beaſt, who is able to make War with him!</hi> v. 3.</p>
            <p>Again, this beaſt is deſcribed by theſe acts which are aſcribed to him, <hi>viz.</hi> his Acts of Idolatrous blaſphemy; and cruel Tyranny.</p>
            <p>Firſt, His acts of Idolatrous blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; for the Scripture is wont to ſet forth Idolatry as Blaſphemous, opprobrious, and contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melious;<note place="margin">See Deut. 31.2.

And there was given to him a mouth ſpeaking great things, and blaſphemies; and then the continuance of this blaſphemous beaſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, And power was given to him to continue 42. months, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. The objects of his blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, or Idolatries, are particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59164:29"/>And he opened his mouth in blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy againſt God, to blaſpheme his name, and his Tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven, v. 6. thinks <hi>Mede,</hi> Gods name by Image-worſhip, his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle Chriſts body,<note place="margin">Here note ſaith <hi>Mede,</hi> the beaſts 42. months are not to be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his euelty and war againſt the Saints, but from the beginning of his blaſphemy, <hi>i. e.</hi> His Idolatry or ſpiritual whoredom, which is, when that is attributed to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which properly belongs to God.

            </p>
            <p>By which image of the beaſt is meant not onely (as was ſhewed before) that Religion which the firſt beaſt (<hi>viz.</hi> the Roman heatheniſh Empire had) and the ſecond beaſt (<hi>viz.</hi> Eccleſiaſtical Rome) ſought to revive, verſ. 14. But alſo a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly portraiture or repreſentation of that power, and authority, and ſoveraignty which the Roman heatheniſh Empire had.</p>
            <p>Now it is ſaid in this 15. verſe, <hi>Datum eſt ei dare ſpiritum, &amp;c. He had power to give life to the image of the beaſt; i.e.</hi> It is given to the falſe Propher, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pope and his Clergy to give life to the Popiſh ſecular power to ſpeak, <hi>i. e.</hi> with power and authority to ſpeak, to command and forbid in all Kingdoms, as well to

            <p>And indeed, all that power that the Image of the Beaſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the Popiſh Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular power hath to rage againſt the Saints, is given him by the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Beaſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pope and his Clergy. Hence the Pope and the Papacy affirm, that even Kings and Emperors have from them whatever they have: So that the German <hi>Ceſar</hi> was not Roman Emperor till he was confirmed by the Pope.</p>
            <p>And an Emperor, ſaith <hi>Aretius,</hi> is but an image of him, choſen indeed by the ſeven Electors of Germany, but confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Pope; for if the Pope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm not the new elect, he is no Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
            <p>And the matter is ſo carried in the exerciſe of this power againſt the Saints, that whom the Pope and his Clergy do condemn for Herefie, as they call it, they forthwith deliver them over to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:59164:39"/> 1. The word <hi>Number</hi> is never uſed in Scripture for the begining and riſing of any term of time limited and predicted by the Prophets, but onely for the end, period and determination thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He calls it the number of a man; by man ſaith he is meant, the total ſum of that ſucceſſion of beaſtly men, which make and conſtitute the exiſtence and perſon of one Antichriſt; and by the word number is meant the fatal end, and fual determination of their raign: and government, for ſo the Finger of God ſpeaketh to <hi>Belſhazer,</hi> God hath num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred thy Kingdom <hi>i. e.</hi> God hath ended and finiſhed the days of thy Kingdom.</p>
            <p>So that by the number of the beaſt, is nothing elſe but the Period and Final determination of the uſurped tyranny and damnation of Antichriſt, which the Lamb, the Lord and preſerver of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for the glory of his name, conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his Church, and confuſion of her foes, ſhall bring to paſs in the year which ſhall be 666.</p>

In which account and diſcovery of his end, the Holy Ghoſt of purpoſe leaves out the millenary number, as not onely known perfect and immutable, but as reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo the common uſe of all Nations, as well Hebrews. as Gentiles, who in their ſtiles (for brevity ſake) do no leſs often ſpeak and write by the imperfect number, omitting the millenary, then after the perfect, adding the millenary, as <hi>Munſter</hi> well obſerves.</p>

               </note> and would be leſs queſtioned then the former, if it did agree with the beginning of the verſe, which the Author calls a little ſhort Preface of the Holy Ghoſt, to prepare his Reader to attention.</p>
            <p>Here is wiſdom,</p>
            <p>That is (ſaith he) here is the diſcovery of a myſtery, a point of high under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and the ſpirit ſaith, not he that will, but he that can, he that hath underſtanding, let him count the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the beaſt; but I rather incline to this opinion then the Former.</p>
            <pb n="64" facs="tcp:59164:41"/>
            <p> The 4 opinion is of thoſe that parallel and compare the number of the beaſt,<note place="margin">Opinion 4</note> 666, with the number of the Lambs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> 144. which are ſet as oppoſites one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and as oppoſites may ſerve to explain one another. To this end, by computation they find that the Lambs number, 144. is onely builded by multiplication of 12. upon 12. and can no otherwiſe be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, ſhewing that the true Church of Chriſt is built onely upon the 12. Apoſtles doctrine, and ſtill holds the foundation in all that is built thereon.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary the beaſts number though it ſeems more compact, accurate, and uniforme, cannot be raiſed nor builded upon 12. take what multiplyer ye will, no, can it be divided or quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by 12 ſhewing that Antichriſts Apoſtatical Church riſeth not on the foundation, much leſs keepeth the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the twelve Apoſtles Doctrine, nor can endure to be tried thereby?</p>
            <p>Thus far <hi>Forbes</hi> in his Comment, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.18. After him Mr. <hi>Potter</hi> hath further improved this Opinion. He ſaith tis called the number of the Beaſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mentioning any name,<note place="margin">Iotter.</note> alſo the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59164:41"/>of a man, without intimating any thing to do with his name. Now the meaning of <hi>Numerus Humanus</hi> is ſuch a number as men uſually deal with, and may be numbred by humane art, but it ſeems there is ſome skill to be uſed herein; for he ſaith <hi>(here is wiſdom)</hi> and let him that hath underſtanding, calculate the number of the beaſt. And the Holy Ghoſt ſets down the very number that is to be numbred 666. which number yet cannot be numbred after the manner of men (which way notwithſtanding is intimated) but by extraction of the roots of theſe two numbers, the root upon which the Lambs number and true Church is raiſed, 144. being twelve, the Apoſtolical baſis; the Root upon which the beaſts number, 666. the character of the Antichriſtian Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatical Church is raiſed, being that fatal number twenty five, both which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes and amplifies at large.</p>
            <p>This Interpretation lights ſo pat upon the Romiſh <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be amazed at ſo exact a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; for this learned Writer hath out of Hiſtory made it even over clear, that 25. is a Character as eſſentially interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into the Hierarchy of <hi>Rome,</hi> as 12.

               <hi>i.e.</hi> Evangelical Miniſters preaching the everlaſting Goſpel againſt the Beaſt and Beaſt-worſhippers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt Angel exhorts all that had given their names to Chriſt by profeſſion, to conſider how Gods judgements were now inflicted upon the Heatheniſh Idols and Idolaters, and therefore to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God the Creator onely and purely, ver. 6, 7.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Angel (the firſt Angels doctrine being deſpiſed) denounceth <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylons</hi> irrevocable ruine from that time forward, till it be conſummated for their obſtinacy and impenitency in Idolatries: The ſubſtance of the Angels doctrine is a commination of <hi>Babylons</hi> fall, with the reaſon of it, verſ. 8. <hi>Babylon is fallen, it is fallen, i.e.</hi> ſhe is now fallen initially, and ſhall fall totally and finally.

            <p n="3">3. The third Angel, going beyond the former, warneth all the Worſhippers of the Beaſt what horrible vengeance hangs over their heads, and would fall upon

               <hi>Parens</hi> thinks this Angel to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of <hi>Luthers</hi> ſucceſſion to the end of the world, from <hi>Anno</hi> 1546. becauſe no fourth Angel follows, but Chriſt ſitting on his white throne of judgement.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As <hi>Babylon</hi> is forewarned, ſo her puniſhments and plagues are not
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59164:55"/>onely threatned,<note place="margin">
                  <p>As the ſeals brought in judgements upon the Pagan world, Trumpets on the Chriſtian world, as ruled by Chriſtian Emperors; ſo the ſeven laſt vials are poured out upon the Antichriſtian world: <hi>Cotton</hi> on the Vials.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſeven plagues are compared to the plagues of Egypt, as Sores, Blood, Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Frogs, Thunder and Lightning. And in the pouring out of theſe vials underſtand nothing but meer divine wrath, no mercy runs out of the vials.</p>
                  <p>Further note, As the ſeven Trumpets were ſounded to the ruine of the Roman Empire, ſo the ſeven Vials are poured out to the ruine of the Beaſt, and to the gradual ruine of the Beaſt they all tend: For every Vial is a degree to the Beaſts deſtruction, who as he roſe, ſo he ſhall rall by degrees.</p>

            <p>This we have in Chap. 15, and 16.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When no reformation doth follow (as did not; for in pouring out of the Vials, it is ſaid, cap. 16. verſ. 9. <hi>They blaſphemed the name of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to give him glory,</hi> ſo verſ. 11. they blaſphemed God becauſe of their plagues, but repented not of their deeds) God paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſentence upon her, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her; which deſtruction is briefly

            <p> And becauſe this victorious Triumph, and gratulation of the Church is for the total ruine and deſtruction of her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; therefore as in the former part of the <hi>Chap. John</hi> ſpeaks of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whore, ſo in the latter part of the <hi>Chap.</hi> he ſpeaks of the judgement of the beaſt, and falſe prophet, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Armies of Adherents, warring againſt the Lamb and his Army.

               <hi>viz.</hi> the beaſt and his adherents are entrapped and enſnared eaſily, and ſuddenly royled by Chriſt; the Beaſt and the falſe Prophet are both taken, as wild beaſts, in Nets and Gins, and are joyntly executed in a moſt dreadful manner, being both caſt alive into a Lake of fire burning with Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone; Their whole Army put to the Sword; and the Fowls invited and filled with their fleſh, and enriched with their prey.</p>
            <p>This is to be underſtood of Chricts final victory, not onely ſpiritually but corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, over the beaſt and falſe Prophet
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59164:56"/>(now vexed and enraged at the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Whore,) and this by ſome remarkable and dreadful demonſtration of his providence.</p>
            <p>In the 20. <hi>Cap.</hi> is ſet down the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Dragon, that old Serpent the Devil and Satan, that had incited and uſed as his inſtruments, the whore, beaſt, and falſe Prophet, and their followers, to oppoſe and perſecute the Lamb and his Saints; and the 21. and 22. <hi>Chap.</hi> containe the Churches happy eſtate, upon her enemies deſtruction, and the glory of the new <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things we may ſee and learn by obſerving intentively the ſcope of the boon of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of Saint <hi>John,</hi> that is, the common term and period whereunto all the particular propheſies and paſſages in the <hi>Revelation</hi> do joyntly run, and wherein they do ultimately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>
            <p>Now having done with the ſcope or Intone of the Book, I am next accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the method I propounded in the beginning, to ſpeak of the</p>
            <div type="synchronisms">
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:59164:57"/>
               <head>Synchroniſmes</head>
               <head type="sub">Which we muſt pouder and weigh adviſedly, in order to the underſtanding of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies contained in this book; concerning which I will premiſe four things.</head>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>Synchroniſme</hi> of Prophecies, is a concurring or meeting together of things foretold in thoſe Propheſies, at the ſame time, or which may be ſaid to be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraneous, or coaetaneous, of the ſame time and age, that fall out or come to paſs in the ſame intervals or ſpaces of time, or if I may ſo phraſe it, that time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The order of the ſeals, and in them of the Trumpets, is certain and indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; the ſame certainly which the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber aſſigned to them both doth indigitate or poynt to as it were with the Finger, <hi>viz.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The Seals are opened one after another in order, in opening of the ſeventh Seal whereof, the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets are ſounded one after another ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:59164:57"/> 3. Therefore the reſt of the Propheſies compared, firſt with themſelves, and then with the Seales by Synchroniſmes, the order of the whole <hi>Revelation</hi> will be made manifeſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Theſe Synchroniſmes are not built upon the Hypotheſis or argument drawn from any interpretation, not do they lean or ſtay upon the praejudgement of the event of things, but upoon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Characters of the viſions themſelves, and are Apodictically or demonſtratively true, to any that have but a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of wit and patience to peruſe them; as theſe Synchroniſmes; The treading underfoot of the outward court, the Witneſſes prophecying in ſackeloth, the Woman in the wilderneſs, the ten horned and two horned Beaſt, the ſealed ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lamb, the whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the ſucceſſion of the firſt ſix Trumpets, (the chief matters of the Apocalyps, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comprehended within theſe Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſmes) All theſe are circumſcribed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſpace of 1200. and 60. days, <hi>i.e.</hi> years.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The dililent and heedful comparing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of viſions that are contemporary, will notably and eſpecially help to the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59164:58"/>more certain defining, and, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the beginning and period of future times, foretold in this book, and ſo to the true underſtanding of the Revelation; It being one of the greateſt difficulties of the Revelation, punctually, and certainly to find out the beginnings and periods of the times therein intended.</p>
               <p>Now in laying them down I will follow my former method, and without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to any mans judgement, I may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue that method which to me ſeemes moſt clear and genuine, moſt plain and eaſie to be underſtood; how-ever the diſpoſing of the Method will not alter the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59164:58"/>childs birth, wherewith the woman travail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the meaſuring the Temple and Altar and them that Worſhip therein, which are Symmetral or commenſurable to the Angels meaſure.<note place="margin">Rev. 11.</note> Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> interprets the fight of the ſeven-headed Dragon and <hi>Michael,</hi> the conflict of the Church of Chriſt, with the Pagan cruelty till <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> his time, which therefore as it is ſynchronal, ſo it hath great Cognation with the viſions of the ſix ſeals. For the Archer on the white Horſe aimes at that effect, all the time of that bloody Battel, which he hits and reacheth in the completion of the ſixth Seal.</p>
               <p>The inward Court of the Temple that is meaſured, ſignifies the pure Chriſtian Church, before it was adulterated by a kind of Chriſtian Paganiſme; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition alſo of the Church, hath a plain cognation with other things ſynchronal; as their reſolute oppoſing the Dragon, and their being ſo ſerious in their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that they preferred it before their own lives, ſo that the meaſure of the Temple and the Altar, and the battel of the ſeven-headed Dragon and <hi>Michael,</hi> are contemporaneous to the ſix firſt
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59164:59"/>Seales, and one to another.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſix firſt Trumpets, ſounding under the ſeventh Seal, appertain to the ſecond Period, when the Empire was turned Chriſtian, and Paganized again under Chriſtianity. So they appertain to the Churches apoſtacy, and the cruel perſecution of the Members of Chriſt in this Apoſtacy. Now I will ſhew you theſe things that are ſynchronal to the ſix firſt Trumpets.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The unmeaſured outward Court of the Temple or holy City given to the Gentiles to be troden under foot,<note place="margin">Rev. 11.2.</note> 42. months.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lords two Witneſſes (at laſt to be overcome and killed by the beaſt, after they have finiſhed their teſtimony) prophecying in Sackcloth 1200 and 60. days.<note place="margin">chap. 11.3</note>

               <p n="3">3. The Woman that brought forth the man child, and fled from the Dragon into the Wilderneſs,<note place="margin">chap. 12.6.</note> and was nouriſhed there 1200 and 60 days, or for a time, times, and half a time.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſeven-headed, and ten-horned beaſt, after the deadly wound of his laſt head was healed, blaſphemeth God and his Tabernacle,<note place="margin">c. 13.5, 6, 7</note> and them that: dwell in
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59164:59"/>Heaven, warreth with, and overcomes the Saints 42, months.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The two horned beaſt or falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, who reſtoreth the firſt beaſt,<note place="margin">Rev. 13.11. to the end of the chapter.</note> and exerciſeth all the power of the firſt beaſt before him, whoſe deadly wound was healed, &amp;c. whoſe number is 666.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Lambs Virgin Company 144000 redeemed from the earth, who alone could learn and ſing the new ſong, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him on Mount <hi>Zion;</hi> the Fear and worſhip of God is commanded,<note place="margin">Rev. 14.</note> the ruine of <hi>Babel,</hi> and them that worſhip the beaſt is threatned.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Babylon</hi> the great Mother of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots and abominations of the earth, ſits upon the ſeven headed beaſt, now in the courſe of his ſeventh head, being ten-horned,<note place="margin">Chap. 17.</note> making the inhabitants of the earth drunk with the Wine of her Fornication, and going to perdition, with which doth Synchronize ſix of the ſeven Vials of Gods wrath, deſtroying the beaſt which are alſo contemporaneous to the ſixt Trumpet. For pouring out the Vials doth bring mine and deſtruction upon the beaſt, as is mannieſt from the text; for the conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59164:60"/>of the beaſt, do ſing the ſong of <hi>Moſes, Cap.</hi> 15.2, 3. And further it doth ſpeciaily appear from the firſt Vial, <hi>Cap.</hi> 16.2. which cauſed a noyſome fore to fall upon the men that had the mark of the beaſt, and on them that did worſhip his Image. And from the fifth vial, <hi>v.</hi> 10. which was poured upon the throne of the beaſt, and his Kingdom was full of darkeneſs; alſo from the ſixth Vials pouring out, provoking unclean ſpirits like Frogs to come out of the mouth of the Dragon, beaſt, and falſe Prophet, who by their ſubtle art of deceiving, ſhall draw the Kings of the earth, and the whole world, <hi>i.e.</hi> all the <hi>Beaſtian</hi> party together to battel againſt Chriſt, to their utter ruine and deſtruction; therefore the pouring out of ſix of the ſeven Vials and deſtroying the beaſt, are contemporane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the ſixth trumpet, alſo contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous one to another.</p>
               <p>Thus I have ſhewed theſe ſeven Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronals to the ſix firſt trumpets founding under the ſeventh Seal, which are alſo contemporaneous one to another.</p>
               <p>Now theſe Viſions that are Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to the ſix firſt Trumpets, though they be more then any Synchronals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59164:60"/>yet they have all a neer cognation and manifeſt colligation one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The general ſummary of the condition of times they point out, is the Apoſtacy and degenerating of the Church, which yet is never conceived ſo all, but that there are ſome pure Apoſtolical Chriſtians in it; and therefore to preſent the two ſotts of Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, there are two ſorts of Viſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thoſe of the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the ten horned beaſt, and the two-horned beaſt relating to the degeneracy of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenſom.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The two Witneſſes mourning in Sickcloth, the Virgin company, the ſealed of the Lamb, to thoſe that kept me purity of the Church, all theſe Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thronize with the ſix firſt Trumpets, out of which is blown the wrath of God upon the Roman Empire, as is but juſt by reaſon of their Apoſtacy: As it is alſo equal with God to protect his own then; And therefore the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the Lamb are Sealed and mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to he kept from the common ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities.</p>

               <p>Theſe are contemporaneous Viſions or myſteries in the Propheſies of this ſacred Book, which give great light to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> and are truly the key of it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>Beſides they miſtake and confound the States one with another; not obſerving where mention is made of the Excleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or Civil State: So that many times they apply Monaſtical matters, and the actions of Antichriſt, to that which is in the <hi>Revelation</hi> ſpoken of the Civil State. Hence it is that the more one doth read ſome Expoſitors, the more one is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</p>
               <p>But by the benefit of this key or guide of Synthroniſms, eaſily appears how na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural a ſenſe is made of every Viſion, and how perfectly anſwerable to Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and events.</p>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59164:64"/>gloſing and flattery, muſt win by little and little to the embracing of his abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, for the more ſpeedy and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer planting of his ten ſeveral hornes.</item>

               </p>
               <p>For the firſt it was to ſall out at or about the three hundredth year after Chriſt; about that time was the volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry changing his ſeat, dividing his Empire, which <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> expounds to be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of the let. 2 Theſ. 2.7.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond, the overrunning of Chriſtendom by the barbarous Nations, when Antichriſt did crouch at the feet of thoſe Tyrants, fawning and flattering them, till out of them ſuch Kingdomes might be ſettled as might give their power to the beaſt: This was to fall out about the four hundredth year after Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For the third, when by theſe hornes he was hoyſed up to that huge height of unjuſt Uſurpation, as to exalt himſelf above Kings and Emperors, ruling not onely in the external and temporal eſtates,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59164:64"/>but even in the faith and conſciences of men, this was about that year after Chriſt, which ſome interpreters make the number of his name to intimate unto us, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.18.</p>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59164:65"/>the Meſſiah; and Antichriſt was grown to his full age and ſtature, before the world took any notice of him: So Antichriſt is neer his end, and going a pace to perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before the moſt of Gods people, do ſo much as begin a little to diſcerne it.</p>
               <p>That this grand earthquake is at hand, appears becauſe the Beaſt Antichriſt, who is to fall by it, is ſo well ſtricken in years, and ſo near his end.</p>
               <p>The whole terme of his life and raign without the womb, (for the myſtery of iniquity was framing this Embrio even from the Apoſtles times, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.7.) is 42. months, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.5. or 1200. and 60. days, that is ſo many years, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a day for a year, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.34. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4.6.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59164:77"/>under the particular viſion of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court of the Temple, further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and remote from the holy of holies, ſignifying the Church ſucceeding the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, in the following ages, ſhould not be in Religion ſo regular, and conforme to the Canon and meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring reed of Gods word, as the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, but ſhould grow irregular and exorbitant, in gentiliſh idolatrous worſhip, Prophaning it, as if heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme were again revived; for heathemiſh Idolatry by Popery is brought in again; The Heathens worſhipped <hi>Saturn, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter, Juno, Venus, &amp;c.</hi> in the Popiſh Religion, <hi>Mary, Peter, Paul, George,</hi> are ſet up in ſtead of theſe, and called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in time of diſtreſs; ſo there is but little difference between them.</p>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59164:78"/>the Tabernacle having but one court (into which ordinarily it was not lawful for any to enter into, but the Prieſts and Levites) there was no outward Court, but the tents of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or the Holy City. So theſe words, outward Court and holy City, mutually explain one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So then by the outward Court here is to be underſtood, the outward worſhip and ſervice of God, which conſiſted in the outward appearance, and a company of ſuperſtitious ceremonies, whereof God takes no notice but rejecteth it; <hi>leave it out, meaſure it not,</hi> ſaith the Angel.</p>

               <p>The finiſhing then of the Teſtimony (I conceive) muſt be by the Magiſtrates and Miniſters of ſome of theſe reformed Churches, who ſhall give in their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony againſt the Churches Apoſtacy, towards the latter end of the 1200 and 60 days.

               <p>And it is likely the Witneſſes of ſome of the reformed Churches, laſt reformed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, compleat and make an end of finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Teſtimony, as the Witneſſes of the firſt reformed Churches begun it.

               <p>
                  <hi>Neither can it certainly be concluded, that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59164:90"/>becauſe this killing that the Beaſt makes of the Witneſſes is the laſt, therefore tis the greateſt and the worſt of all that went before it. But it hath and deſerves a ſingular men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deſcription amongſt all the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Beaſt, perhaps not ſo much for the greatneſs of it (ſure not becauſe of the continuance of it) as becauſe it was to be a ſign that the mourning of the witneſſes ſhould end ſoon after it, and that the ruine of the City of</hi> Rome <hi>ſhould inſtantly follow it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fo as the compaſſing about of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>with Armies,</hi> Luk. 21.20. <hi>did foretel and was a ſign her deſtruction and deſolation was at hand, and near at her drors; the like here may be intimated (as we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) concerning the deſtruction of</hi> Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon; <hi>when you ſhall ſee that triennial ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Witneſſes, then know the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of that great City of</hi> Rome <hi>it at hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this killing of the Witneſſes by the Beaſt or his party, is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood according to the forecited Author, and all late Interpreters, metaphorically or analogically of a civil death. For he is ſaid to dye in that notion or ſenſe, who in that ſtation wherein he ſtood ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Political or Eccleſiaſtical, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59164:90"/>ceaſeth to be what he was; hence he is ſaid to kill,<note place="margin">The ſlaying of the Witneſſes is to be underſtood not of a corporal but civil death: <hi>Caryl</hi> on <hi>Job</hi> cap. 21. 7.</note> that doth puniſh any man with ſuch a death. For in Scripture language to live, is often to be, to die is not to be; in which ſenſe we are ſaid to dye to ſin, when we are no longer the ſervants to ſin; and to live to Chriſt, when we begin to be Chriſts.</p>
               <p>Furthermore,<note place="margin">This killing is plainly meant a kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as Witneſſes, not as men; a throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them out of their places and ſtations, as if, naturally dead. Whether this ſad time be paſt, preſent, or to come, I leave others to judge.</note> it appears by the following Verſes, it muſt be meant of a civil death, ver. 8. <hi>Their dead bonies lying in the ſtreet of the great City three days and a half;</hi> this ſhews it cannot be meant of a natural death; for how ſhould their bodies lye dead in that ſenſe, for three years and a half, or ſay it were for ſhorter time?</p>
               <p>Again, it is clear from verſ. 11. For look what the reſurrection of the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to life ſhall be after their killing and lying dead ſuch a time, ſuch muſt needs be the killing; for no reſurrection pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called can come to paſs before Chriſts coming under the ſeventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet.

               <p>Now that we may come as near to the true ſenſe and meaning of theſe words as poſſibly we can, I will lay down and prove two things which will be good grounds to go upon in the explication of the Text.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe no judgement can befal the Beaſt but what is contained in ſome of the Vials: This ſame ruine of <hi>Rome</hi> here deſcribed belongs to the fifth Vial; the proof of which is, there is the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the plague in both places, <hi>viz.</hi> in
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59164:97"/>this 11. chap. and in chap. 16. here tis the great City, there it is the throne and ſeat of the Beaſt; for <hi>Rome,</hi> the great City, to be the ſeat of the beaſt, is ſo well known that it needs no proof. It is further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, becauſe the ruine that is here deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, doth ſo nearly precede the total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Beaſt, at the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet, as nothing is ſaid to intervene or come between but the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing away of the ſecond wo. But now to the total abolition of the Beaſt is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary the pouring out of the ſeventh Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; to the paſſing away of the ſecond wo, or that plague from <hi>Euphrates,</hi> is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the pouring out of the fixt Vial; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the deſtruction of the great City which goes next before the paſſing away of the ſecond wo, doth belong to the fifth Vial.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing premiſed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in order to the interpretation of this verſe, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ipe of the great City in verſ. 13. is the very ſame deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Babylon</hi> which is prophefied of <hi>c.</hi> 18. which I prove thus, becauſe it is certain from that Chapter, that that very ſame deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> or of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> doth go before the full deſtruction
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59164:98"/>of the Beaſt, and the beginning of Chriſts glorious Kingdom, at the founding of the ſeventh Trumpet. But now the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the City which is here declared, doth ſo nigh antecede that very Kingdom of Chriſt, that the Spirit of God (making mention of no other deſtruction between) paſſeth immediately to that kingdom, and the deſcription of the ſeventh Trumpet. Therefore one and the ſame deſtruction of that City muſt of neceſſity be deſcribed in both; for who can imagine or beleive that the holy Ghoſt ſhould altogether paſs by the greateſt deſtruction of all, and make mention of ſome leſſer ſlaughters between, no way to be compared to it.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being ſo, it follows then, that the Interpretation of theſe words be levelled to this rule, and as it were tried by this touchſtone, and ſo to ſeek ſuch a ſenſe and meaning of theſe words as doth beſt agree with the deſcription of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Babylon;</hi> which with what reaſon may be, we may now ſee.<note place="margin">Beſides, the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the touth part of the City fell]</hi> By which (I conceive) is not meant the tenth
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59164:98"/>out of many Kingdoms given to the Pope, now taken from him; for then the word ſhould be rather <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, then <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p>But by this ΔΕΚΑΤΟΝ, this tenth part of the City, I agree with <hi>Mede,</hi> is meant the fall and deſtruction of whole <hi>Rome,</hi> the City that now is, which is but the tenth part of that which it was, when it was in its glory. The City of <hi>Rome</hi> that now is, in regard of the old City of <hi>Rome,</hi> when ſhe was in her flouriſhing condition, is but the tenth part, as the ſame is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>Lipſius.</hi> The holy Ghoſt in the words intimates as much.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Admirand</hi> lib. 3.</note> So much of the great City as was remaining when the great earthquake came, at that time was ruined, <hi>viz.</hi> the tenth part of the City; for nine parts many ages before were fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, partly by the deſolations of war brought upon it ſo many times by the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous nations, and partly decayed and worn away with time, and partly deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with lightning and tempeſt; the tenth was reſerved for the fate of the Papal
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59164:99"/>ſtate, the mother of Harlots, which by this earthquake, at the reſurrection of the Witneſſes ſhall be utterly deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>It is added, <hi>And in the earthquake wire ſlain of men</hi> (Greek) <hi>names of men, ſeven thouſand.</hi>] Note here, the Text doth not ſay 7000 are ſlain by the fall of the City, but 7000 are ſlain in the earthquake, which earthquake is to ſhake down the whole kingdom of the Beaſt throughout the world; therefore by the 7000 men muſt not be underſtood (I conceive) ſo many individual perſons. For tis not likely the pouring out of the Vial upon the throne of the Beaſt, will paſs away with ſo ſmall a ſlaughter of men. Sure we are, ſhaking down of the whole kingdom of the Beaſt, the total deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 16.</note> which the holy Ghoſt intimates by this earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake elſewhere in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> will not be without the ſlaughter of a far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er number then 7000 men. To ſatisfit this doubt therefore, we muſt conſider what may be meant by the City here, and what by the names of men.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The City or great City, hath a double acceptation in theſe Propheſies, Being taken either for</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:59164:99"/>
               <p> Firſt, The Royal City of the Beaſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the City of <hi>Rome;</hi> called the throne or ſeat of the Beaſt, upon which the fifth Vial is poured out; or,</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the Citizens, or for the Romiſh City, conſtituted of the Pope and his Cardinals, and the whole troop of the Romiſh clergy, who, <hi>Rome</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, burnt to aſhes and levelled to the ground, not to be inhabited any more, ſhall betake themſelves to another habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and ſo ſhall be reſerved to the laſt Vial, at the pouring out of which it is ſaid (beſides the deſtruction of others, of all lands, Nations and Cities, in this earthquake ſo great as never was ſuch ſince man was upon the face of the earth) great <hi>Babylon</hi> came into remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceneſs of his wrath.</p>
               <p>For that burning and deſtruction of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> (taken for the Royal City of the beaſt) that is deſcribed, <hi>Chap.</hi> 18, <hi>and</hi> 19. doth altogether precede the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the beaſt and the Falſe Prophet, as is manifeſt in the Text. To ſum up all in a word, happily it may ſo come to paſs, that, that firſt deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59164:100"/>viz.</hi> of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> may be without any very great ſlaughter, at leaſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the total deſtruction of the Citizens; for though the City be utterly deſtroyed, yet a great part of the Citizens may fly from the deſtruction of the City, timely conſulting their own ſafety, or for ſome other cauſe, which the event will make manifeſt; and thus the doubt or ſcruple concerning the ſmall number of the ſlain may be ſatisfied.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And will yet more fully, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what number may be deſigned in the words, <hi>names of Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Names of men]</hi> may be taken for eminent and renowned Men, high and great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, cheif heads of Noble Families. <hi>Names of men,</hi> is as much as to ſay men of name; An Hypallage frequent in Scripture, as ſilver Shekels for Shekels of ſilver, <hi>Levit.</hi> 5. the Law of righteouſneſs, for the righteouſneſs of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. Riches of grace for rich grace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. So names of men may here be put for men of name, perſons of great honor and dignity, in oppoſition to men without name, baſe and ignoble Perſons, <hi>Job</hi> 30. According to this interpretation (which nothing can be ſaid againſt) <hi>Names of Men</hi>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:59164:100"/>ſignifing high and great perſons (ſuppoſe they be of the Popiſh Eccleſiaſtical Order, whom we call Church men by great names and titles, diſtinguiſhed from the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Clergy) if 7000 of theſe be ſlayn, how many of a lower rank and order, which the Holy Ghoſt would not ſo much as count or reckon?</p>
               <p>Beſides this, there may another inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation be given of <hi>(Names of Men) viz.</hi> Companies and Societies of men, which are wont to be called by proper names, as well as particular men, as Cities, Towns, Pariſhes, Villages, Monaſteries, and Nunneries; and what are theſe (if we conſider the Matter) but names of men, as the Roman name is put for the Romans themſelves; the <hi>Thebane</hi> Polity, is called the <hi>Thebane</hi> name; what is therefore the Names of thoſe humane Societies, whether they be either of <hi>Rome,</hi> or in that they call the Church State, be the 7000 in this great Earthquake to be ſlain, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſubdued by the adverſe power, which the Scripture uſeth to call death; but we muſt not raſhly determine any thing in a thing to come; the beſt commentary of a Prophecy, is the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it; but I bring theſe things to ſhew,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59164:101"/>that of theſe words a larger ſenſe may be given then is commonly conceived. When the word (Name) in Scripture doth not uſe to be reſtrained to one ſingle ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, neither are (Names of men) joyned together in any place of Scripture but in this, neither is the word (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) Names, taken ſimply for particular ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſons, but onely in two places, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.15. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.4. in other places it hath ſeveral ſignifications.</p>
               <p>It follows, <hi>And the remnant were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, and gave glory to the God of Heaven</hi>] <hi>i. e.</hi> the reſt of the <hi>Beſtian</hi> party, are amazed and terrified, and thereby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to acknowledge the juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, which he hath poured out upon them, and to confeſs their ſins, which to do, is to give glory to God.</p>
